# Morse Code Reference

## Overview
Morse code is a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots (`.`) and dashes (`_`). It is commonly used in radio communication and signaling.

This document provides a mapping of **English letters, numbers, and special characters** to their corresponding Morse code representations.

## Usage
Morse code can be transmitted through:
- **Light signals (e.g., flashlight blinks)**
- **Sound signals (e.g., beeping tones in radios)**
- **Written format (as seen above)**
- **Tap codes (e.g., tapping on surfaces in prisons or emergencies)**

To separate words, use `/` (slash). Example:
```
HELLO WORLD -> .... . ._.. ._.. ___ / .__ ___ ._. ._.. _..
```

## Additional Notes
- Each Morse code symbol represents one letter, number, or special character.
- Morse code is **case-insensitive** (i.e., `A` and `a` are encoded the same way).
- Spaces between characters are short, while spaces between words are longer.
